The downside of this is that you have a library with very many functions which are then not necessarily used on your web pages but which are still read by the browser after each click. With the new tools, it only retrieves the features you need to display related content on the website that results in a lightning-fast user experience.`,
      `Old tools can often lead to slower websites in today's standard which will cause you to score lower in search engines and be even slower on mobile devices compared to others using newer technology. JQuery is also a very controversial topic in modern web development due to many of these factors. Even today, most websites still use JQuery.`,
      `The customers of web developers who have no experience with web technology can then be gullible and think they are getting the best for their money as they can get lots of code delivered that they do not need.`,
      `This also applies as far as CMS (content management system) such as WordPress, Joomla and the like that run huge amounts of files with a lot of extra you do not need.`,
      `Fortunately, there are constantly new technologies in web development that I myself will use and hope more people will do the same. The time it takes to load a page is more noticed in recent times where we have higher internet speeds.`
